A contiguous subsequence of a list S is a subsequence made up of consecutive
elements of S. For instance, if S is
5, 15,−30, 10,−5, 40, 10,
then 15,−30, 10 is a contiguous subsequence but 5, 15, 40 is not. Give a
linear-time algorithm for the following task:
Input: A list of numbers, a1, a2, . . . , an.
Output: The contiguous subsequence of maximum sum (a subsequence
of length zero has sum zero).
For the preceding example, the answer would be 10,−5, 40, 10, with a sum of 55.
(Hint: For each j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, consider contiguous subsequences ending
exactly at position j .)
